# MayinTarlasi / Minesweeper
The project is a simple console based minesweeper game. It works mainly with two matrises named gtahta and stahta.
Program first takes input for the desired row and collumn amount and gives a choice of difficulty ranging from 1 to 3.
After the initial inputs are given the game board will be made accordingly and the game will start.
Each time the user is asked what row and collum they want to make a move on, and then they are asked wheter they want to open the cell or to flag it.
If all cells are opened without any mine being opened, YOU WIN. But if you open a mine in any point, YOU LOSE.
Have fun :).
